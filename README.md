# Teasy

> A tiny tool to make teaching easier.

Teasy allows to select an application window to be mirrored into an *external monitor window*. You can choose the application to mirror by using the *control and preview window*. I use it during live programming classes, where I project only the IDE, keeping my cluttered desktop for myself :).

## Features

You have a customizable laser pointer, which appears whenever you hover on the actual application window

You can also hide temporarily the app from the main monitor window and show a clock (with a configurable timer) instead. I find this very useful to signal when the lecture is going to be resumed during a break.

## Todo

* Add a live twitter stream (with moderation). In this way students can participate by sending questions which can then be shown in realtime.
* Add twitter polls.
